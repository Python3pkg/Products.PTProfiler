Installing PTProfiler

    Download the profiler package and unpack it in the Zope Products
    directory. The package should hook itself into the pagetemplate code
    without any modification. To view the results, place a 'PTProfiler Viewer'
    somewhere in the Zope tree (see also README.txt).

    Requirements:

        Zope (tested on Zope 2.5.1 and Zope 2.6.1)
