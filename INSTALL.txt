Installing PTProfiler

    Download the profiler package and unpack it in the Zope Products directory.
    The package should hook itself into the pagetemplate code without any
    modification. To enable profiling and view the results, place a 'PTProfiler
    Viewer' somewhere in the Zope tree (see also README.txt).

    Requirements:

        Zope 2.x (tested on Zope 2.5.x, 2.6.x and 2.7.x)
